## Infrastructure Automation Enthusiast

I'm passionate about building and automating infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. I have experience with various technologies, including:

* **Terraform:**  Provisioning and managing cloud resources in a declarative and repeatable way.
* **GitHub:** Version control, collaboration, and code deployment for infrastructure projects.
* **Packer:** Building identical machine images for different platforms, ensuring consistency across deployments.
* **Azure:** Microsoft's cloud computing platform for deploying and managing applications.
* **AWS:** Amazon Web Services, another major cloud provider for scalable and cost-effective infrastructure.
* **Kubernetes:** Deploy container apps in a container orchestrator

This profile showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy robust infrastructure solutions.
